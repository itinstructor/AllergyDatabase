# Food Allergy Database (Kivy)

A small cross-platform Kivy application to store food allergies in a local SQLite database, rate danger levels, and search ingredients.

Repository contents

- `allergy_database.py` ‚Äî application logic and Kivy App
- `allergydatabase.kv` ‚Äî KV layout (UI)
- `buildozer.spec` ‚Äî Android packaging config
- `tools/generate_placeholders.py` ‚Äî helper to create example `icon.png` and `presplash.png`
- `icon.png`, `presplash.png` ‚Äî placeholder images (replace with production art before release)

Quick start ‚Äî run on Windows

Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (3.13 used in development)
- Kivy 2.3.1

Install and run

```powershell
python -m pip install kivy==2.3.1
python allergy_database.py
```

On first run the app creates `allergies.db` in the working directory.

App features

- Add allergy entries (name, danger level 1‚Äì4, symptoms, ingredients, notes)
- View a list of allergies (sorted by danger level)
- Search by allergen name or ingredients (case-insensitive)
- Delete entries with confirmation

Android build (local)

The project is prepared for Buildozer packaging. Build Android packages on Linux/WSL/macOS.

Basic local steps (WSL / Ubuntu example)

```bash
# install buildozer dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential git python3-pip python3-virtualenv
pip install --user buildozer

# build (from repo root)
buildozer android debug
```

Notes

- `buildozer.spec` points at `icon.png` and `presplash.png` in the repository root. Update `icon.filename` / `presplash.filename` if you place assets elsewhere.
- For Play Store releases you must sign the build with a Java keystore. CI in this project can decode a base64 keystore secret; locally set `android.release_keystore`, `android.release_keyalias`, and key passwords in `buildozer.spec`.

Placeholder images

Generate example placeholders with:

```powershell
python tools/generate_placeholders.py
```

This writes `icon.png` (512√ó512) and `presplash.png` (2732√ó2732) to the repo root.

Troubleshooting

- If the app fails to start, verify Kivy is installed and check the console for tracebacks.
- If UI elements are duplicated, ensure `allergydatabase.kv` is present and the app is started from the repository root so Kivy can find and load the KV file.
- For Buildozer failures, run `buildozer -v android debug` and inspect the logs for missing recipes or toolchain errors.

Developer notes

- UI: KV-first approach ‚Äî presentation in `allergydatabase.kv`, logic in `allergy_database.py`.
- Data: SQLite file `allergies.db` created in the working directory.
- Popup timeout: controlled by `UIConfig.success_popup_timeout` in `allergy_database.py`.

Want help next?

- I can add Play Store publishing automation to CI (requires Play service account keys).
- I can generate Android resource variants (mipmap) and update `buildozer.spec`.
- I can add unit tests for the `DatabaseManager`.

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

## How this app works (for beginners)

This short walkthrough explains the app architecture in plain terms:

- The app uses Kivy for the user interface and SQLite (a small file-based
   database) to store allergy records.
- The UI is split into separate screens (Main menu, Add, List, Search).
   We switch screens using a ScreenManager. Each Screen is defined by a
   Python class in `allergy_database.py` and its layout is described in the
   KV file `allergy_database.kv`.
- Widgets declared in the KV file get `id` names. From Python we can access
   those widgets with `self.ids.<id_name>` inside a Screen class.
- The `DatabaseManager` class opens `allergies.db`, creates the table on
   first run, and provides simple methods: `add_allergy`, `get_all_allergies`,
   `search_allergies`, and `delete_allergy`.
- Popups are used to show quick messages. The app auto-closes success
   popups after a short timeout so the user doesn't need to dismiss them.

Suggested quick experiment for learners:

1. Open `allergy_database.py` and find the `DatabaseManager.add_allergy` method. Add a print statement before the INSERT to see what data is being stored.
2. Run the app and add a sample allergy. Open `allergies.db` with the `sqlite3` command-line tool or a GUI SQLite browser to inspect the table.
3. Open `allergy_database.kv` and change the text on the main menu buttons. Save and re-run to see how KV changes the UI.

## üéâ Success Metrics

# Food Allergy Database (Kivy)

This is a small cross-platform Kivy application that stores food allergies in a local SQLite database, lets you rate the danger level, and search ingredients.

This repository contains:

- `allergy_database.py` ‚Äî application logic, database manager, and Kivy App class
- `allergydatabase.kv` ‚Äî KV layout file (single source of truth for the UI)
- `buildozer.spec` ‚Äî Android packaging configuration (for use with Buildozer / python-for-android)
- `icon.png`, `presplash.png` ‚Äî placeholder images (generated by `tools/generate_placeholders.py`). Replace with production assets as needed

## Quick start ‚Äî run on Windows

Requirements:

- Python 3.10+ (3.13 was used during development)
- Kivy 2.3.1 (pinned in `buildozer.spec` and recommended for parity)

Install dependencies (recommended in a virtualenv):

```powershell
python -m pip install kivy==2.3.1
```

Run the app:

```powershell
python allergy_database.py
```

The app will create `allergies.db` in the working directory on first run.

## App features

- Add new allergy entries with name, danger level (1‚Äì4), symptoms, ingredients, and notes
- List all allergies ordered by danger level
- Search by allergen name or ingredients (case-insensitive substring match)
- Delete entries with confirmation

UI details:

- The UI is defined in `allergydatabase.kv` to avoid duplication and keep layout portable between desktop and mobile
- `UIConfig` in `allergy_database.py` detects the platform and sets larger touch targets on mobile

## Android build (local)

This project is prepared for packaging with Buildozer (Linux/WSL or macOS required for android builds). The repo already includes a `buildozer.spec` with pinned Kivy and placeholder assets.

Basic local steps (on WSL or a Linux machine):

```bash
# install buildozer & dependencies (on Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential git python3-pip python3-virtualenv
pip install --user buildozer

# in repo root
buildozer android debug
```

Notes:

- `buildozer.spec` expects `icon.png` and `presplash.png` at the repo root (these are present as placeholders). If you move or rename them, update `icon.filename` and `presplash.filename` in `buildozer.spec`
- For a Play Store release, you will need a Java keystore for signing. CI in this project decodes a base64 keystore secret; locally you can set `android.release_keystore`, `android.release_keyalias`, and the passwords in `buildozer.spec` (or provide them via environment)

## Placeholder images

A small helper script generates the example images used in this repo:

```powershell
python tools/generate_placeholders.py
```

It will create `icon.png` (512√ó512) and `presplash.png` (2732√ó2732) at the repo root. Replace them with your finalized artwork before releasing.

## Troubleshooting

- If the app fails to start on Windows, ensure Kivy is installed and your Python version is compatible. Check the console for tracebacks
- If screens show duplicated widgets, ensure the KV file `allergydatabase.kv` is present and the app is started from the repository root so Kivy can load the KV file automatically
- For Android build failures, run Buildozer in verbose mode (`buildozer -v android debug`) and read the log for missing recipes or dependency issues

## Developer notes

- Architecture: KV-first UI (presentation) + Python controllers (logic) in `allergy_database.py`
- Database: SQLite file `allergies.db` created in working directory
- Popup auto-dismiss timeout is configurable via `UIConfig.success_popup_timeout` in `allergy_database.py`

If you'd like, I can add:

- Play Store publishing steps in the CI workflow (requires Play Console service account keys)
- additional image sizes and `res/` folder layout for Android
- automated unit tests for the database layer
